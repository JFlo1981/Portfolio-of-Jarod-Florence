# Portfolio-of-Jarod-Florence


## Challenge 2: Build a portfolio to showcase my projects and provide connection information to prospective employers.

## Built with:
* HTML
* CSS

### This project was built from the ground up using HTML for the framework and CSS to provide a look and feel.

My job on this project is to use the skills obtained thus far in my training to build a portfolio for showcasing my skills, introducing myself to to workforce community and providing contact info for those reaching out.

I was able to achieve this by drawing out a basic wireframe design of how I wanted my webpage to look.  I then applied these basic design thoughts to an HTML file and styled the page using CSS.

The page consists of a header with navigation links to various parts of the webpage, a banner section to grab attention, a brief bio section with a photo of myself, a section of project examples with embedded links to said projects, a contact section with links to several ways to connect with me and a footer to finish the page.
